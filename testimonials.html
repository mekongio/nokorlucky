                            Apartments for the past five months, and I've been 
                            very happy with the cleanliness, security, and quality 
                            of service in general. The staff really tries hard 
                            to address any questions or concerns that I have in 
                            a timely manner. I was thrilled last week when I emailed 
                            to ask about a problem with the treadmill, and the 
                            management purchased a new one within two days! I 
                            like that the building is within a 10 minute walk 
                            of three major grocery stores and the Central Market. 
                            Also, I feel safe at Nokor Lucky, which is something 
                            that obviously is quite important. I definitely recommend 
                            Nokor Lucky for both short and longer term stays...</p>

                            you made for us. We'd a wonderful time during our 
                            stay. Mr. Kinet &amp; colleague, Mr. Saron and Ms 
                            Sockjie have been very friendly and helpful. My kids 
                            and family were very touch and grateful for the warm 
                            extension provided. It&#8217;s awesome.<br>
                            <br>
                            I'll strongly encourage your place to my pals, friends 
                            and colleague who plan to visit Cambodia in future. 
                            Please keep in touch with us. If possible, we may

                    <p align="justify">Norkor Lucky is very nice condo. The room is very large, good working air conditioning, nice kitchen, big living room, very clean bathroom with super power presure hot and cold water, and nice dinner tables. It is very reasonable price for each different room. There are few securities policing 24hrs. a day, guess sign in out with a proper badge while visiting Norkor Lucky. Norkor Lucky is very close to the super market and shopping center just half of mile away. I would stronly recomment to everyone. </p>
